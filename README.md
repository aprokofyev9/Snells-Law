# Snells-Law
Physics 454 simulation

This is a physics simulation I created for my Descriptive Astronomy class using p5.js. 
I utilized Windows 10 with node.js to create a local http-server with no caching to visualize my progress in real-time.
I used atom to write and edit the code as I worked.

I chose Snell's Law as my simulation topic because light travels at different speeds when passing through different mediums. This applies to light entering a telescope, passing through gas, and other situations, which are relevant to our study of astrophysics.
It was also relatively simple as far as the math was concerned. This choice was made delibaretely since I have never coded anything before (aside from amateur Matlab work and a CodeAcademy course on Python). I therefore had to spend some time learning javascript and the p5.js iteration specifically to get this to work correctly.
